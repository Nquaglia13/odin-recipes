    <h1 class="titulo"> My Top 3 Recipes</h1>
    <p>A collection of some of the best recipes i've come across during my years as a hungry student. 
        This are cheap recipes, easy to follow, and will help you surprise your guests. 
        From the mix of italian and mexican cultures in a great spicy chicken pasta, to the corners of south america in the form of a fresh ceviche, 
        to finally some classic confort food in the way of a veggie soup.
